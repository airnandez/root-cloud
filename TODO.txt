TODO
----

*  Add support for multi-range HTTP requests and multi-part HTTP responses and
   overwrite TFile::ReadBuffers method for THttpFile and sub-classes.

*  Add support for Rackspace identity v2 API which allows for runtime discovery
   of the storage endpoints a user may have data in.

*  Improve handling of HTTP redirect responses. For instance, Google Storage
   in some cases responds with redirects (status 302) which are currently
   not followed.
